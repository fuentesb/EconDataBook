# Welcome {-}

This resource is written for Economics students at the University of Bristol to bridge the gap between technical documents about economic concepts and text book treatments of economic concepts. Each chapter concludes with a list of references to more detailed descriptions, mainly by statistical agencies. 

Please let me know if you find mistakes, find a section unclear, have suggestions for improvements, or if you have request for further topics to include. You can contact me on h.h.sievertsen@bristol.ac.uk.

Thanks,
Hans
